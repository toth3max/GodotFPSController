# GodotFPSController
Godot turorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_vI3WoAHGY

Textures from https://kenney.nl/assets/prototype-textures

Built with Godot 4.0.1 on Ubuntu 22.10.

Added Input.warp_mouse() to the camera code to not have the camera roatation be bound to the screen edges. Should this really be necessary for Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED?
